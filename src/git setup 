// When We have two Git profile and have to switch between them
// Make the most frequent one as global and the other as local
// for local git follow below:
/* git config --local user.name "Your Name"
   git config --local user.email "
            OR
    after downloading initial file from https://start.spring.io/
    git init
    After initializing, you can set your user name:
    git config user.name "the-sky7"
    git config user.email "yourpersonal@email.com"

    To test which GitHub account will be used when you push:
    Check your remote URL:
    git remote -v
    If it shows an SSH URL (git@github.com:...), the account depends on your loaded SSH key.
    Test your SSH key (if using SSH):
    ssh -T git@github.com
    This will display the GitHub username associated with your current SSH key.

    Create a repository on your personal GitHub account.
    Add it as a remote:
    git remote add origin <your-personal-repo-url>
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    Push your code:
    git push -u origin main
    Start developing features, writing tests, and committing changes.
